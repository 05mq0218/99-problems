# Ninety-Nine Java 8 Problems

This is an adaptation of the [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland.

I will use Java 8 features so that developers can learn how to use new features introduced in Java 8. If you are new to Java 8 then you can learn more about it by following my in-depth [Java 8 tutorial](https://github.com/shekhargulati/java8-the-missing-tutorial).
